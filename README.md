# KanbOS
###A self-make operating system with the book called 30 days to build OS ourselves

###Giving us a way to make our own OS within this book. I also push tools given by the author so you can run it directly using bat files in directory KanbOS

###I will push some new attributes after finish reading this book. This res just a copy of my codes




####Update 1st day: complete build an easy 'OS' called helloos using machine code

####Update 2nd day: try to rebuild the helloos within an more readable 8086 assembly lang, also learn to use makefile to compile the codes.
