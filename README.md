# KanbOS
####A self-make operating system with the book called 30 days to build OS ourselves

####Giving us a way to make our own OS within this book, I also push tools given by the author so you can run it directly using bat files in directory KanbOS

####I will push some new attributes after finishing reading this book. This res just a copy of my codes


-------------------

**Update 1st day**: complete build an easy 'OS' called helloos using machine code

**Update 2nd day**: try to rebuild the helloos within an more readable 8086 assembly lang, also learn to use makefile to compile the codes.

**Update 3rd day**: this time we make a real IPL to boot our OS from disk.
- The first demo is about the way to boot program from disk using INT 0x13
- The second demo is about how to handle error when reading disk
- The third demo is about to read until 18th section. All content will be put into 0x8200 to 0xa3ff
